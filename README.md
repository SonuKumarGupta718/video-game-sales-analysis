# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis | Python-Based EDA Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global video game sales dataset using Python. The goal was to uncover insights about sales trends across genres, publishers, and regions—empowering data-driven understanding of the video game industry's dynamics.

## 🧠 Insights Unlocked with Data & Visuals
- 🔹 **Top Performing Genres**: Sports, Action, and Shooter dominate global sales.
- 🔹 **Publisher Impact**: Identified top 10 publishers contributing most to global sales.
- 🔹 **Genre-wise Sales Distribution**: Visualized with bar charts and pie charts.
- 🔹 **Regional Trends**: Analyzed performance across North America, Europe, and Japan.
- 🔹 **Outlier Detection**: Used boxplots and IQR methods to highlight anomalies.
- 🔹 **Sales Correlation**: Explored relationships among different sales regions with a heatmap.
- 🔹 **Statistical Summaries**: Used mean, median, skewness to assess numeric distributions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- `Pandas` – Data manipulation
- `NumPy` – Numerical operations
- `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` – Data visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` – Interactive analysis environment
